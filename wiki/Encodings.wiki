#summary String and message encodings in Java.

=Encodings=

==Convert a string from one encoding to another==
In some cases this is an easy and required step. For example, if we want to write special characters as name in an email address, its default encoding is `ISO-8859-1`, meanwhile the name can come from a database with an encoding of `UTF-8`.

This code snippet converts a string:
{{{
    final String utf8Message = "Some message containing special characters: éáíúűó";
    
    final String isoMessage  = new String( utf8Message.getBytes( "UTF-8" ), "ISO-8859-1" );
}}}

==Reading from and writing to a file or stream using a specific encoding==
This is supported by default in the standard library. We can simply use the `java.io.InputStreamReader` and `java.io.OutputStreamWriter` classes which can take the character encoding as their constructor parameters.
